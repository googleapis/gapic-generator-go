# If the package name of the generated package is "a/b/c", we write files under directory "$OUT/a/b/c",
# where OUT is the directory passed to protoc. Prior to Go 1.11, we set OUT=$GOPATH/src.
# This works well because that's where we expect to find the package a/b/c.
#
# This plays badly with modules however. In `go mod init` above, we set our module name to "showcase-test",
# and set module root to showcase-testdir (because that's where the file is). If we set OUT=showcase-testdir,
# we generate the files to showcase-testdir/a/b/c, but the import path of this package would actually be showcase-testdir/a/b/c,
# not a/b/c as expected from the previous paragraph. We have to rewrite imports to keep this working.
#
# We copy this behavior from protoc-gen-go, so they're probably having the same problem with modules. Therefore...
# TODO(pongad): figure out what protoc-gen-go is doing to solve this then do the same thing.
